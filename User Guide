Naviagting the program:
When given items listed numerically, type in the number of the item you wish to select
When asked a binary question type 'yes' to confirm or enter anything else to deny

Pieces:
Piece movement is represented by 2-dimensional vectors. These can be interpreted in two ways:
1:As a leaping vector, in which case the piece can move once by that vector in all directions
2:As a riding vector, in which case the piece can move infinitely by that vector until it is blocked.
(so a knight is a [1,2] leaper and a bishop is a [1,1] rider
A piece's status can either be common or royal. The properties of royal pieces are dependent on the game's win condition

Win conditions:
1:Checkmate: the standard rules of Chess, games can result in checkmate on any royal piece for either side or stalemate
2:Regicide: the laws of check do not apply, if an enemy royal is captured, the game is won
3:King of the Hill: Same as the Checkmate but with hill squares which give victory to a player that moves their royal piece onto the hill.
4:Extinction: The laws of check do not apply, all enemy pieces must be captured to win.
Custom rulesets are not playable unless there are sufficient pieces for the win condition to be achieved.
